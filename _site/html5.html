  <h1>htm - convert plain text to HTML 2.0, auto-linked.</h1>
  <pre>

Usage

    import htm from "htm"
    const text = "plain text"
    const html = htm(text)

The returned value is a string contaning valid [HTML 2.0].
The first line will be the TITLE and H1 heading.
The remaining part will be enclosed with a PRE element,
with links auto-linked.

Besides HTML 2.0, ISO HTML and HTML5 are also supported.
Below is the type definition in TypeScript:

    type htmlVariant = "tags" | "html2" | "iso" | "html5";
    const html: (text: string, variant: htmlVariant) =&gt; string;

In fact, `htm(text)` is just a shortcut for `html(text, "html2")`.

HTML 2.0 is the first standard of HTML, published in 1995.
ISO HTML, published as an ISO standard in 2000,
is almost identical to HTML 4.01 Strict.
HTML 4.01, published in 1999,
is the most widely adopted standard in the first decade of the 21st century.
HTML5 is the current recommendation by all mainstream web browsers.  

It also supports generating HTML tags, the HTML language before 2.0,
which was published in 1991 and is the first publicly available description of HTML.
Auto-link is not supported when specifying this as the output format.


Markdown Compatibility

The input is supposed to be plain text.
However, the following Markdown syntax is supported:

- If the first line starts with `# `, then the leading `# ` will be trimmed.

- Inline links (brackets immediately followed with parentheses) will be converted to links,
  without displaying the URL.
